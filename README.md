# 16-Bit-RISC-Processor-using-verilog
A 16-bit RISC Processor implemented in Verilog HDL, designed to execute a reduced set of instructions with efficiency and speed. The project demonstrates modular design of processor components including ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Instruction &amp; Data Memory, along with testbenches and simulations.
