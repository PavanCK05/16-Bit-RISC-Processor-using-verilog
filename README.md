# 16-Bit-RISC-Processor-using-verilog

## üìå Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a **16-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) Processor** using **Verilog HDL**.  
RISC processors use a small, optimized instruction set, enabling fast execution and simplified hardware design.  

The processor is modular, consisting of:
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
- **Register File**
- **Control Unit**
- **Instruction & Data Memory**
- **Program Counter**
- **Testbenches for simulation**

The design is verified through simulation using tools such as **ModelSim** or **Vivado**.
